 i.) 
 As seen from the results, the run time in assembly is faster than C and this is more apparent in larger sample sizes. When the vector size becomes larger, the time complexity between both languages become more apparent. One of the reasons for this is C still goes through a compiler and other processes to translate the C code into machine language. Assembly doesn't need a compiler  but instead is directly mapped from between assembly language and machine language by the assembler. So the arithmetic operations in the calculation would be "translated" faster in assembly language.

 Equation for sum of squares: (n(n + 1)(2n + 1)) / 6

 Vector size: 2^20

 Vector size: 2^24
